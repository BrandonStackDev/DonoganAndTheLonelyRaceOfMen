What You Can Do

Play the game! That’s kind of the point.

Poke around the code, models, and music for your own personal projects. Learn from it, mess with it, remix it.

Show it off to your friends, your mom, or your cat.

What You Cannot Do

You may not clone Donogan (the character, story, or this game) and try to sell it, pass it off as yours.

If you want to sell something that mostly came from Donogan, the rule of thumb would be is it your own now. If you really make your own thing, Thats fine.
But just in the spirit of not being lame, dont just change 3 lines and try to sell it. Thats weak.

Liability Stuff (a.k.a. “Don’t Sue Me, Bro”)

This game is provided as is. If it breaks your computer, ruins your GPA, causes Donogan to show up in your dreams, or makes your dog judge your life choices — that’s on you, not me.

I make no warranties of any kind, implied or otherwise. By playing, you accept this risk like a true adventurer.

In short:
Play the game, mess with the guts for fun, don’t resell Donogan, and don’t sue me if things go sideways. Cool? Cool.

Also, dont, give, a moose, a cookie. He will never leave.
